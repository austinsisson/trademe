      %h4 Austin Sisson
      %p Hey there! I built this app with restaurant servers and bartenders in mind, but I think it can be applied to any industry where employees frequently trade shifts, but don't always have an easy way to keep track. TradeMe is a work in progress, and I would love to hear what you think about it!
